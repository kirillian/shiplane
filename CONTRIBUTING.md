# Welcome!

We're so glad you want to contribute to [Shiplane](https://github.com/kirillian/shiplane)! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this CONTRIBUTING policy, [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and [README](README.md).

## Submitting PRs or Issues

- Make sure to fill out the templates as completely as you possibly can.
- Try to err on the side of giving too much information
- If you find a bug, create a minimum replicable test case so that we can replicate it too. If we are not able to replicate an issue, it takes much longer to troubleshoot or we might be unable to do so at all.

## Contributing Agreement
