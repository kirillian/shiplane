# build-essential Cookbook

[![Cookbook Version](http://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/build-essential.svg)][cookbook] [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/build-essential.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/build-essential)

Installs packages required for compiling C software from source. Use this cookbook if you wish to compile C programs, or install RubyGems with native extensions. Contains a resource, 'build_essential', as as well as a default recipe that simply calls that same resource.

## Deprecation

The functionality of this cookbook is now built into Chef 14+ in the [build_essential resource](https://docs.chef.io/resource_build_essential.html). This cookbook is no longer being maintained and all future changes will be done directly in the chef-client. We highly recommend you update your chef-client to the latest release and if possible migrate to using the build_essential resources instead of the recipe in this cookbook.

## Requirements

### Platforms

- Debian/Ubuntu
- RHEL/CentOS/Scientific/Amazon/Oracle
- openSUSE / SUSE Enterprise Linux
- SmartOS
- Fedora
- Mac OS X 10.9+
- FreeBSD

### Chef

- Chef 12.7+

### Cookbooks

- seven_zip
- mingw

**Note for Debian platform family:** On Debian platform-family systems, it is recommended that `apt-get update` be run, to ensure that the package cache is updated. It's not in the scope of this cookbook to do that, as it can [create a duplicate resource](https://tickets.chef.io/browse/CHEF-3694). We recommend using the [apt](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/apt) cookbook to do this.

## Attributes

Attribute                                  |            Default            | Description
------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------: | -----------------------------------------------------
`node['build-essential']['compile_time']`  |            `false`            | Execute resources at compile time
`node['build-essential']['msys2']['path']` | `#{ENV['SYSTEMDRIVE']\\msys2` | Destination for msys2 build tool chain (Windows only)

## Usage

### Recipe Usage

The recipe simply calls the build_essential resource, but it ideal for adding to roles or node run lists.

Include the build-essential recipe in your run list:

```sh
knife node run_list add NODE "recipe[build-essential::default]"
```

or add the build-essential recipe as a dependency and include it from inside another cookbook:

```ruby
include_recipe 'build-essential::default'
```

### Gems with C extensions

For RubyGems that include native C extensions you wish to use with Chef, you should do the following.

- Set the `compile_time` attribute to true in your wrapper cookbook or role:

  ```ruby
   # Wrapper attribute
   default['build-essential']['compile_time'] = true
  ```

  ```ruby
   # Role
   default_attributes(
     'build-essential' => {
       'compile_time' => true
     }
   )
  ```

- Ensure that the C libraries, which include files and other assorted "dev"

  type packages, are installed in the compile phase after the build-essential

  recipe is executed. For example:

  ```ruby
   include_recipe 'build-essential::default'

   package('mypackage-devel') { action :nothing }.run_action(:install)
  ```

- Use the `chef_gem` resource in your recipe to install the gem with the native

  extension:

  ```ruby
   chef_gem 'gem-with-native-extension'
  ```

### Resource Usage

The cookbook includes a resource 'build_essential' that can be included in your cookbook to install the necessary build-essential packages

Simple package installation during the client run:

```ruby
build_essential 'some name you choose'
```

Package installation during the compile phase:

```ruby
build_essential 'some name you choose' do
  compile_time false
end
```
