  "long_description": "# build-essential Cookbook\n\n[![Cookbook Version](http://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/build-essential.svg)][cookbook] [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/build-essential.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/build-essential)\n\nInstalls packages required for compiling C software from source. Use this cookbook if you wish to compile C programs, or install RubyGems with native extensions. Contains a resource, 'build_essential', as as well as a default recipe that simply calls that same resource.\n\n## Deprecation\n\nThe functionality of this cookbook is now built into Chef 14+ in the [build_essential resource](https://docs.chef.io/resource_build_essential.html). This cookbook is no longer being maintained and all future changes will be done directly in the chef-client. We highly recommend you update your chef-client to the latest release and if possible migrate to using the build_essential resources instead of the recipe in this cookbook.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- Debian/Ubuntu\n- RHEL/CentOS/Scientific/Amazon/Oracle\n- openSUSE / SUSE Enterprise Linux\n- SmartOS\n- Fedora\n- Mac OS X 10.9+\n- FreeBSD\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.7+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- seven_zip\n- mingw\n\n**Note for Debian platform family:** On Debian platform-family systems, it is recommended that `apt-get update` be run, to ensure that the package cache is updated. It's not in the scope of this cookbook to do that, as it can [create a duplicate resource](https://tickets.chef.io/browse/CHEF-3694). We recommend using the [apt](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/apt) cookbook to do this.\n\n## Attributes\n\nAttribute                                  |            Default            | Description\n------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------: | -----------------------------------------------------\n`node['build-essential']['compile_time']`  |            `false`            | Execute resources at compile time\n`node['build-essential']['msys2']['path']` | `#{ENV['SYSTEMDRIVE']\\\\msys2` | Destination for msys2 build tool chain (Windows only)\n\n## Usage\n\n### Recipe Usage\n\nThe recipe simply calls the build_essential resource, but it ideal for adding to roles or node run lists.\n\nInclude the build-essential recipe in your run list:\n\n```sh\nknife node run_list add NODE \"recipe[build-essential::default]\"\n```\n\nor add the build-essential recipe as a dependency and include it from inside another cookbook:\n\n```ruby\ninclude_recipe 'build-essential::default'\n```\n\n### Gems with C extensions\n\nFor RubyGems that include native C extensions you wish to use with Chef, you should do the following.\n\n- Set the `compile_time` attribute to true in your wrapper cookbook or role:\n\n  ```ruby\n   # Wrapper attribute\n   default['build-essential']['compile_time'] = true\n  ```\n\n  ```ruby\n   # Role\n   default_attributes(\n     'build-essential' => {\n       'compile_time' => true\n     }\n   )\n  ```\n\n- Ensure that the C libraries, which include files and other assorted \"dev\"\n\n  type packages, are installed in the compile phase after the build-essential\n\n  recipe is executed. For example:\n\n  ```ruby\n   include_recipe 'build-essential::default'\n\n   package('mypackage-devel') { action :nothing }.run_action(:install)\n  ```\n\n- Use the `chef_gem` resource in your recipe to install the gem with the native\n\n  extension:\n\n  ```ruby\n   chef_gem 'gem-with-native-extension'\n  ```\n\n### Resource Usage\n\nThe cookbook includes a resource 'build_essential' that can be included in your cookbook to install the necessary build-essential packages\n\nSimple package installation during the client run:\n\n```ruby\nbuild_essential 'some name you choose'\n```\n\nPackage installation during the compile phase:\n\n```ruby\nbuild_essential 'some name you choose' do\n  compile_time false\nend\n```\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThis cookbook is maintained by Chef's Community Cookbook Engineering team.
