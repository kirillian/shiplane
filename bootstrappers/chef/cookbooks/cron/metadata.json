{"name":"cron","version":"6.2.1","description":"Installs cron","long_description":"# cron Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/cron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/cron) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/cron.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/cron)\n\nInstalls the cron package and starts the crond service.\n\nNote: Chef 14.4 shipped with the cron_d and cron_access (cron_manage) resources. When Chef 15.4 ships in Aug 2019 these resources will be removed from this cookbook as all users should be on Chef 14.4 or later.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- RHEL family\n- Debian family\n- Solaris family\n- FreeBSD\n- SUSE family\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.7+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- none\n\n## Resources\n\n### `cron_d`\n\nThe `cron_d` custom resource can be used to manage files in `/etc/cron.d`. It supports the same interface as Chef's built-in `cron` resource:\n\n#### Properties\n\n- `cron_name` - Set the name of the cron job. If this isn't specified we'll use the resource name.\n- `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `month`, `weekday` - schedule your cron job. These correspond exactly to their equivalents in the crontab file. All default to \"*\".\n- `predefined_value` - schedule your cron job with one of the special predefined value instead of _**_ * pattern. This correspond to `\"@reboot\"`, `\"@yearly\"`, `\"@annually\"`, `\"@monthly\"`, `\"@weekly\"`, `\"@daily\"`, `\"@midnight\"` or `\"@hourly\"`.\n- `command` - the command to run. Required.\n- `user` - the user to run as. Defaults to \"root\".\n- `mailto`, `path`, `home`, `shell`, `random_delay` - set the corresponding environment variables in the cron.d file. No default.\n- `environment` - a Hash containing additional arbitrary environment variables under which the cron job will be run (similar to the `shell` LWRP). No default.\n- `comment` - A comment to place in the cron.d file\n- `mode` - the octal mode of the generated crontab file. Defaults to `0600`.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```ruby\ncron_d 'daily-usage-report' do\n  minute  0\n  hour    23\n  command '/srv/app/scripts/daily_report'\n  user    'appuser'\nend\n```\n\n```ruby\ncron_d 'Setup the daily usage cron job' do\n  cron_name 'daily-usage-report'\n  minute  0\n  hour    23\n  command '/srv/app/scripts/daily_report'\n  user    'appuser'\nend\n```\n\n### `cron_access`\n\nThe `cron_access` resource can be used to manage the `/etc/cron.allow` and `/etc/cron.deny` files.\n\nNote: This resource was previously a Chef definition cron_manage. The legacy name will still function, but should be updated.\n\n#### Actions\n\n- `:deny` - Add the user to the cron.deny file (default).\n- `:allow` - Add the user to the cron.allow file.\n\n#### Properties\n\n- `user` - username that you want to control. If not provided the resource name will be used as the user.\n\n#### Examples\n\nThe following will add the user mike to the `/etc/cron.allow` file:\n\n```ruby\ncron_access 'mike' do\n  action :allow\nend\n```\n\nThe following will add the user john to the `/etc/cron.deny` file:\n\n```ruby\ncron_access \"Make sure john can't touch cron\" do\n  user 'john'\n  action :deny  #optional, deny is the default\nend\n```\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThis cookbook is maintained by Chef's Community Cookbook Engineering team.
