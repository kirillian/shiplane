Description

This cookbook configures the available and default locales on a debian-like-system.
It also includes a LWRP for easy use in other cookbooks.

Limitation

Right now the cookbook *only works with UTF-8 locales*.

Requirements
============

None

Attributes
==========

* `node[:locales][:default]` -- the default locale to be installed. Defaults to "en_US.utf8".

locales "de_AT.utf8" do
  action :add
end
```

```ruby
locales "Add locales" do
  locales ["fr_FR.utf8", "fr_BE.utf8", "fr_CA.utf8"]
end
